# CameraOverhaul Vintage

It's a clientside mod that attempts to improve overall satisfaction of the game through the introduction of various camera rotations, to emphasize on the player's movement and improve visual feedback. Strafing and turning around will tilt the camera sideways. Jumping, falling, and moving forward/backwards will affect the camera's pitch.
